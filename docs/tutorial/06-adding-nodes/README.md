# #06. Adding Nodes

This is a web-version of a tutorial chapter embedded right into the XOD IDE.
To get a better learning experience we recommend to install the
<a href="/downloads/">desktop IDE</a> or start the
<a href="/ide/">browser-based IDE</a>, and you’ll see the same tutorial there.

There are several ways you can add a new node to the patch in XOD. The effect is
the same, use one that is more handy for a given situation.

## How-to

For instance, let’s add few new `led` nodes.

One way is using the Project Browser. In the node list, you will find the
`xod/common-hardware` section. This is a _library_ where you can find nodes for
working with specific hardware. Find the `led` node there. Note that the nodes
are arranged in alphabetical order. Hover the cursor over the `led` node, and
click the burger

slot.

Alternatively, you may _drag_ the node from the Project Browser instead of using
the context menu.

Yet another way to add a node is the Quick Search feature. Press “I” key or
_double-click_ anywhere on the patch. Then type what you are looking for. It
searches not only in nodes titles, but even in the nodes description, like a
small and dumb built-in Google.
